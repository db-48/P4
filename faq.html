<h1>FAQ</h1>
    <br>
<p>
    <ol>
    <li class="questions">I'm an absolute beginner. Where should I start?</li>
<div class="answer">Beginners with no prior experience should sign up for any intro level classes in the apparatus of your choice wether it be Silk, Hammock, Lyra or Aerial Yoga.
    If you can’t decide on a favorite the easiest apparatus to start training on is Aerial Hammock. Skills learned in one apparatus will translate to another if you decide to change over later.
    For more details on the above classes, please see Descriptions.</div>
    <br>

<li class="questions">How strong do I need to be to begin training aerials?</li>
    <div class="answer">You don’t need any amount of upper body strength to begin training aerials–that said the stronger you are,
        the easier it will be for you to progress quickly.
        Most aerial instructors assume that new students coming in have never tried anything like aerials in their life, and are not used
        to lifting/pushing/pulling their own body weight. </div>
    <br>
<li class="questions">I’m really excited for my first class! What should I do to prepare?</li>
    <div class="answer">Anything physical that you can do, including cardio, will help to get you in shape for your first lesson.
        Aerial work really targets the upper body and core however, so putting more of your focus on those areas will be beneficial to your training in the long run.
        It’s really important to make sure that every exercise you do you’re doing with proper form and engagement to prevent injury.
         </div>
    <br>
<li class="questions">What if I am afraid of heights?</li>
    <div class="answer">Do not worry!
        We have very small class sizes and our instructors are sensitive to working with students who have issues with heights.
        Beginners work right off of the mat and moves are spotted by instructors.</div>
    <br>

<li class="questions">What are aerial classes like?</li>
    <div class="answer">Aerial classes are usually 60 minutes long. Class includes warm up, conditioning, Aerial skills, and cool down.
        Class sizes tend to be small so each student will receive a lot of individual attention.
        </div>
    <br>
<li class="questions">Who can participate? Am I too old?</li>
    <div class="answer">Anyone can do the Aerial Arts. Your age or fitness level does not determine your ability.
        Most people are surprised after taking a class, to learn they did much more than they initially thought.
        This is because our bodies can do amazing things!</div>
    <br>
    <li class="questions">What if I’m not strong enough?</li>
    <div class="answer">It's assumed that most students don’t have any upper body or core strength when they first start
        and the goal of all studios is to build up those skills!
        That said, the stronger you are the easier it will be for you to progress more quickly.</div>
    <br>
    <li class="questions">What should I wear or bring to my first class?</li>
    <div class="answer">Different apparatuses require different attire,
        so check the course description for details. In general, no jewelry for safety. No shoes needed.
        Bring water to stay hydrated!</div>
    <br>
    <li class="questions">I’m worried that I won’t be good at this....</li>
    <div class="answer">Learning any type of aerial acrobatics can be challenging, both physically and mentally -
        its a skill and it takes time and practice, be patient and kind to yourself. The most  important thing
        is to accomplish your personal goals. Always remember that your instructor is  there to help!</div>
    <br>
    <li class="questions">I just had my first class and now I feel like I have the flu and can’t lift my arms.</li>
    <div class="answer">That’s totally normal. You are going to be sore as your body adjusts to doing new activity.
        Treat yourself by relaxing and gently stretch.</div>
