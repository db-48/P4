            <p class="lead mb-4">Quake's four separate episodes all have different feels and styles. This is no coincidence, as each map is designed by multiple people.</p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">The map to be discussed here was designed by Tim Willits, and is considered the first proper level.</p>
            <h4>E1M2: Castle of the Damned</h4>

            <p class="lead mb-4">Castle of the Damned is the second level of the Dimension of the Doomed. A relatively small castle with several Water canals running through it, the player is introduced to the Medieval style they will generally be spending their time in.</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="lead mb-4">In this level, the player also has their first encounters with the Monsters used in most game levels, and must find a Silver Key to proceed deeper into the castle. Many Secrets can be found by swimming in the Water. </p>

            </figure>
            <p class="lead mb-4">Although intended as a Single Player level, this map is also considered one of the most popular Multiplayer (Deathmatch) maps, beating some maps specifically designed for Deathmatch. This is also one of the most popular levels for team Deathmatches. </p>

            </figure>
            <p class="lead mb-4">Above is a zoomed out overview of the whole level. It employs not a linear "room to room" style which would be boring, but interconnected rooms to allow for natural exploration. The player moves from the top left room to the bottom right to complete the level.</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="lead mb-4">One other technique this map showcases is using small skybox brushes in order to make the map feel more real. These are used on various windows as well.</p>
